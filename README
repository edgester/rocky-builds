Some quick and dirty scripts to generating a lsit of missing source build
dependencies in CENTOS8.  Run the numbered scripts in order. scripts without a
number are just helpers run by other scripts.

File list:
1-gen-pkg-list             # list all packages available in dnf
2-get-all                  # get build dependencies for all packages
3-get-available-src-pkgs   # grab a list of all source packages that are available
4-merge-requires           # merge all the build dependencies into a combined list
5-show-missing-src-pkgs    # show missing source packages
build-dep-list.txt         # the combined list of source dependencies
get-package-builddeps      # helper script to get thebuild deps for a single package
missing-build-dep-list.txt # list of missing build dependencies
packages                   # list of all available packages
README
requires/                  # directory that contains a list of each packages build dependencies, on file per package
source-pkg-list            # list of all source packages available via dnf
